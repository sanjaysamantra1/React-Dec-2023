Arrow Function
--------------
-'this' value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on the context in which it is called.
-'this' inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to 'this' where the function is declared.
-lexical context means that arrow function uses 'this' from the code that contains the arrow function.
-Regular function ( this = how the function is invoked/who invoked )
-Arrow function( this = where the function is declared )


Arrow Function Limitations
--------------------------
-Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this, arguments or super cann't be used inside arrow function.
-Arrow functions don't have access to the new,target keyword.
-Arrow functions aren't suitable for call, apply and bind methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.
-Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors.
-Arrow functions cannot use yield, within its body.

Functions 
=========
-function is a block of code/statements designed to perform a particular task.
-function is executed only when that gets invoked/called.
-function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
-The code to be executed(function body), by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
-Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
-Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
-Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

1. pre-defined (alert(),prompt(),confirm(),max(),min(),sqrt(),cbrt())
	already written, we are just using them
2. user-defined
	we have to write,and we will use them
   
   a. function declaration (named function)
   b. function expression(anonymous)
   c. self invoked ( IIFE- Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
   d. arrow function (ES - 6)(2015)
  

Note:
=====
Parameter: is the variable in the function declaration. 
		   It is part of the function signature when you create it.
Argument: is the actual value of the variable being passed to the function when it is called.



Function Declaration			Function Expression
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Named						1. Anonymous
2. Hoisting - yes				2. Hoisting - No
3. creation phase(parse)		3. execution phase (run)

   
-A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.
-A Function Declaration can be called before it is defined.
-function declarations are parsed before their execution. 
 function expressions are parsed only when the script engine encounters it during execution.

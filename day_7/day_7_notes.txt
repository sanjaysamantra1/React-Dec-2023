To run any JS code , we dont need any software
- browser is enough to run JS code

- Inside Every Browser , JS engine is there 
- JS engine helps to execute JS code

Chrome : V8 engine
Firefox : Spidermonkey engine
IE : Chakra engine
safari  : javascript Core



How Javascript Works
====================
-When JavaScript engine executes a script, it creates N execution contexts.
-Execution context is the environment within which the current code is being executed.
-Each execution context has two phases: 
	1. creation phase. (Allocates memory - variables & functions and assign 'undefined' to variables)
	2. execution phase. (Code gets Executed - assign values to variables & method invocation)
-When a script executes for the first time,JavaScript engine creates a 'Global Execution Context' and pushes to callstack.
-For every function call,JavaScript engine creates a new Function Execution Context and that gets added to callstack.

heap - This is the area where variables and methods are stored physically.
Stack  - also called  callstack / ExecutionStack
         This is the place where functions will be places one above other,
         the top 1 gets excuted first then top-1,top-2 and so on
Note : CallBack functions cann't be placed inside callstack directly,
       they will have to wait in callback queue & they will go to stack only when normal functions are executed

CallbackQueue - This is the queue which maintains all the callbacks
Task Queue - setTimeout(),setInterval() related callbacks
Microtask Queue - Promise() related callbacks

EventLoop - EventLoop keeps an eye on callstack & callback queue, when it find the callstack free , it pulls a callback function from callback queue and assigns it to call stack for execution.

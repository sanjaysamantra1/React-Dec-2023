object vs map
-------------
1. object keys must be strings/symbol, where as map keys can be of any type.
2. we can get the size of a Map easily.  ex: map.size
   for object size has to be calculated manually. ex: Object.keys(obj).length
3.The iteration of maps is in insertion order of the elements
4.Objects are not inherently iterable (Object.keys() is slow), Maps are iterable.

Eliminate Render-Blocking JavaScript
====================================
-With HTML5, we got two new boolean attributes for the <script> tag : async and defer.
 ex:- <script src='demo.js' async/defer></script>
-async/defer attribute should only be used on external scripts, not with internal scripts.
-These attributes only make sense while using the script in the head portion of the page.
-A good strategy is to use async when possible, and then defer when async isn’t an option.
-With async, the file gets downloaded asynchronously and then executed as soon as it’s downloaded.
-With defer, the file gets downloaded asynchronously, but executed only when the document parsing is completed.
-With defer, scripts will execute in the same order as they are called. 
 defer is useful when a script depends on another script.
